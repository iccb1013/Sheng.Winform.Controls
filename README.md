Please visit the original code repository for the latest updates: https://github.com/iccb1013/Sheng.Winform.Controls .

Shen .Net WinForm Control Library provides more than 15 WinForm controls. You can use this control library directly, and more importantly, you can learn the methods and concepts of WinForm control development through it.

You will learn:

How to implement a fully functional WinForm control from scratch based on the Control class.
How to use the GDI+ drawing interface and interact with user actions.
How different design patterns are applied in WinForm control development.
Many people think that design patterns are only used to solve problems in large-scale solutions. However, here you will see that design patterns are not just for breaking down large projects‚Äî even for developing a single WinForm control, a well-structured design pattern can help you decompose and solve problems efficiently.

For example, the Prototype Pattern‚Äîalthough I could explain this pattern in detail, I struggled to find a practical application for it until I discovered that Microsoft used it in implementing DataGridView to solve several key issues. That was an eye-opener.

Other design patterns, such as Factory Pattern, Builder Pattern, and Command Pattern, also have highly relevant use cases in complex WinForm control development.

The source code includes detailed comments, which I believe will help you in reading and utilizing it effectively.
